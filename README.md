## Compiling

1. Clone and compile [Plutonium](https://github.com/XorTroll/Plutonium) and place it in a folder called `Plutonium` in this project's root. Make sure Plutonium's lib directory is `[THIS PROJECT]/Plutonium/lib`.

1. Compile using `make`, this requires the same things that Plutonium requires so compiling that should need to install the same things you need for this.
